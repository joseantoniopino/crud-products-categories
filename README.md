## BOOTSTRAPPING
The project is dockerized. For ease of use, a makefile has been created with different commands.

To start the project for the first time:

`make build`

`make start`

To enter the container we will use

`make ssh-be`

And there we will use `composer install` to install dependencies

You can create your own `.env` file
`.env.example` is a good template for this.

For help to use, `art` is an alias of `php artisan`
